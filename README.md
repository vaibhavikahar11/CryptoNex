## 📂 Core Features

### 💬 AI Chatbot – "Crypto Assistant"

* Handles natural crypto-related queries like *"BTC price today"*
* Fetches market data & historical trends instantly
* Powered by Gemini & CoinGecko APIs

### 📊 Trading & Portfolio

* Buy & Sell interface with live rates
* Performance tracking with visual stats
* Auto-refreshing portfolio balances

### 💳 Wallet & Payments

* Secure wallet-to-wallet transfers

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1️⃣ Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vaibhavikahar11/CryptoNex
```

### 2️⃣ Backend Setup

```bash
cd Cryptonex-Backend-master
mvn clean install
mvn spring-boot:run
```

* Update `application.properties` with:

  * MySQL credentials
  * API keys for Gemini & CoinGecko
  * Razorpay & Stripe keys

### 3️⃣ Frontend Setup

```bash
cd Cryptonex-Frontend-main
npm install
npm run dev
```

* Add `.env` file with:

  * Backend API URL
  * Payment gateway keys

---


## 🛠 Challenges Solved

* **Real-Time Data Handling:** Optimized API calls to refresh prices without overloading APIs.
* **State Management:** Used Redux to sync data between trading, wallet, and portfolio modules.
* **Payment Reliability:** Built a dual-gateway payment system to ensure uptime.
* **Security:** Enforced 2FA for sensitive wallet and bank transactions.

---

## 🎯 Why This Project Stands Out

* Shows **full-stack expertise** with both frontend and backend development.
* Demonstrates **fintech problem-solving skills** in authentication, payments, and data handling.
* Fully deployed demo accessible from anywhere.
* Reflects **production-grade coding practices** and **scalable architecture**.
