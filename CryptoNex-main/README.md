## 🎯 Why This Project Stands Out

* Shows **full-stack expertise** with both frontend and backend development.
* Demonstrates **fintech problem-solving skills** in authentication, payments, and data handling.
* Fully deployed demo accessible from anywhere.
* Reflects **production-grade coding practices** and **scalable architecture**.
